# TODO

- Generate text for training: should be two very large images, one with and one without antialias, containing some random text. For now just one font size is enough. I could use Firefox to take two screenshots? Key property is that the antialiasing should not affect text placement. Let's try this as it's easiest.

- Create a propper data bunch from the images

# DONE
