# Antialias with Deep Learning

Adds antialiasing (smooth edges) to an image containing black & white (1bit) drawings and text.

Here are some examples, which are ideally viewed without browser scaling. They show the B&W image, followed by the algorithm output, followed by the ground truth (original image, with proper antialiasing):
